This comes exactly 11 years after the devastating 2013 floods that caused billions in damage and displaced over 100,000 residents.

  'Hurricane Harvey brought unprecedented rainfall to the Houston metropolitan area, with some areas receiving over 60 inches of rain in just four days. The storm stalled over the region, causing catastrophic flooding that inundated hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses. Buffalo Bayou, Braes Bayou, and other waterways overflowed their banks, turning streets into rivers. Emergency responders conducted over 17,000 water rescues. The flooding was exacerbated by the urban heat island effect and extensive development in flood-prone areas. Many victims were trapped in their homes and had to be rescued from rooftops. The economic impact included disruption to the energy sector, with numerous refineries and petrochemical plants shutting down operations.',

Downtown Calgary was evacuated as the Bow River reached levels not seen since 1932. The Saddledome was flooded with water reaching row 8 of the lower bowl. Entire neighborhoods including Sunnyside, Hillhurst, Bowness, and Elbow Park were inundated. The flooding forced the evacuation of over 100,000 people, making it one of the largest peacetime evacuations in Canadian history.
